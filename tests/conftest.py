"""
The fixtures for all tests of the app.

pytest loads this file before any test. It keeps the temporary files of a run
in ```tmp/tests/``` of the project and gives every test the fixtures ```tmp```
and ```rando```; a test takes a fixture by naming it as argument.

### Example

```python
def test_report_is_written(tmp):
    # tmp.dir is an empty directory, tmp.file an empty file next to it
    path = os.path.join(tmp.dir, 'report.txt')
    with open(path, 'w') as f:
        f.write('done')
    assert os.listdir(tmp.dir) == ['report.txt']


def test_lock_of_its_own(rando):
    # a name on a shared server, a parallel run takes another one
    name = f'test_lock_{rando}'
    ...
```

### Notes

- Every test gets its own ```tmp``` and ```rando```, nothing is shared
- ```tmp``` gives paths as str for code and test apps that want them,
    ```tmp_path``` of pytest gives a ```pathlib.Path```
- pytest empties ```tmp/tests/``` at the start of the next run, so a test
    cleans nothing up and its files stay for a look until then
- ```pytest --basetemp=<dir>``` puts the temporary files there instead
- A fixture goes into this file only if every test may need it, the
    fixtures of a subject stay in its test files
