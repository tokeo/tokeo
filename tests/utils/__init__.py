"""
The helpers for all tests of the app.

General tools every test may import: the root of the project, the markers
of the stress tests and of the tests in a fresh process, waiting for a
condition and an empty stdin for a step. They hold no asserts, the test
asserts on what they return. The classes live in modules of their own and
are imported by their full path: ```tests.utils.process``` runs a program
as a process of its own, ```tests.utils.tui``` runs a program in a pseudo
terminal, ```tests.utils.nicegui``` runs an app in the user simulation of
nicegui, ```tests.utils.isolation``` runs a test in a pytest of its own.

### Example

```python
from tests.utils import ROOT, stresstest, isolated, wait_until, wait_until_async
from tests.utils import free_port, wait_process_group_ended
from tests.utils import use_disabled_stdin_capture
from tests.utils.process import SubProcess
from tests.utils.tui import Terminal
from tests.utils.nicegui import NiceguiSimulation
from tests.utils.isolation import IsolatedPytest
```

The stress tests run only with ```make test STRESSTESTS=1```, marked by
```stresstest```:

```python
pytestmark = stresstest          # all tests of the file


@stresstest                      # one test
def test_worker_stress_hands_every_message_on_once():
    ...
```

A test that needs a process without the state of the running pytest, e.g.
one that forks, is marked by ```isolated```:

```python
@isolated
def test_counts_in_a_fork():
    ...
```

### Notes

- Only code that is truly general and needed again and again goes here,
    code of one subject stays with that subject

def wait_until(check, timeout=5.0, interval=0.02):

    Call check until it holds or the timeout ends, return its last value.

    - **check** (callable): Called without arguments, holds when its value

    - **interval** (float): The seconds between two calls

    Wait until every process of the group ended, return whether they did.

    A program started with ```start_new_session=True``` leads its own group,
