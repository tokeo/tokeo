"""
The wasm sandbox: real isolation against untrusted code, not just cleanup.

It runs a tool call inside a WebAssembly guest under Wasmtime. The guest is a
user-supplied CPython-WASI build (the ```runtime```/```stdlib``` options); the
host writes the task as JSON into a private scratch dir mounted read-write at
```/io```, a small bundled guest entry script rebuilds the tool and writes the
```ToolResult``` back to ```/io/reply.json```. The guest has NO network (the
syscalls do not exist in its world), sees NO host file outside the explicit
```mounts```, and runs under a hard memory cap (Wasmtime store limits, the same
on every platform) and an epoch timeout. This is deny-by-default: a tool that
needs a path or the network must be granted it explicitly, or run in a
different sandbox.

### Notes

: The tool is rebuilt in the guest from its dotted ```type``` and ```options```
    with ```app=None``` -- a guest has no live parent app, and the uniformity
    rule means a tool that needs an app builds it itself. Only JSON-able
    arguments and the ```ToolResult``` text/data cross the bridge. Unlike the
    subprocess sandbox there is no parent-path injection: nothing is visible
    that the config did not mount, on purpose -- visibility is the whole point
    of choosing wasm.

: Full documentation -- when to use it, the two python-exec tools, installing a
    WASI Python build into ```./wasm```, every option, the file bridge, the two
    trust models, the WASI stdlib shims, and troubleshooting -- lives in
    ```WASM.md``` next to this module.
