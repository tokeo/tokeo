"""
The subprocess sandbox: fault and resource isolation, not a jail.

It runs a tool call in a fresh interpreter through the generic runner
(```python -m tokeo.core.ai.sandboxes.runner```), feeding the job as JSON on
stdin and reading the ```ToolResult``` as JSON on stdout. The child gets its
own interpreter, a wall-clock timeout (then SIGKILL), an enforced memory cap
(RLIMIT_AS, with RLIMIT_DATA as fallback; current macos rejects caps below
the already-mapped virtual size -- gigabytes at interpreter start -- so a
realistic cap errors the call there instead of silently running uncapped),
a working directory, and a scrubbed environment. A crashing or run-away tool
is contained from the parent -- but this is NOT a jail against hostile code:
it cannot stop the tool from reading files or reaching the network. Real path
or network isolation needs a container, VM, or WASM backend the user supplies.

### Notes

: The tool is rebuilt in the child from its dotted ```type``` and ```options```
    (carried on the instance by the handler), with ```app=None``` -- a child has
    no live parent app, and the uniformity rule means a tool that needs an app
    builds it itself. Only JSON-able arguments and the ```ToolResult```
    text/data cross the boundary.
