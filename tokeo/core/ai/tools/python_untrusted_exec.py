"""
The ```python_untrusted_exec``` tool: run model-generated Python in isolation.

This is the CodeAct pattern for code you must NOT trust. The snippet runs by a
direct guest path that imports nothing from tokeo -- the wasm guest sees only
its standard library and the code itself, never the framework. That keeps the
isolation total: the model-generated code cannot even read tokeo's own modules.

### Security

: !!! DANGER !!! This tool executes arbitrary, model-generated code. It MUST
    only be configured to run inside the ```wasm``` sandbox (no network, only
    the stdlib, hard memory cap) or a hardened, throwaway ```docker```
    container. Running it ```in_process``` or in the plain ```subprocess```
    sandbox gives generated code full host access -- file reads, network,
    process spawn -- which a prompt-injection can turn into data exfiltration
    or worse. The sandbox is not optional for this tool; it is the only thing
    that makes it safe.

### Notes

: ```wasm_direct_exec = True``` tells the wasm sandbox to run the ```code```
    argument directly in the guest, WITHOUT rebuilding this tool there -- so no
    tokeo mount is needed and the untrusted code stays walled off from the
    framework. The contract with the generated code: assign the model-facing
    answer to a variable named ```result```; it is coerced to text. The same
    ```exec``` body also runs in process (for tests or a trusted agent that
    deliberately chose no sandbox), so the tool is self-contained either way.
