    read configuration, use ```app.db```, the vault, and hold resources.
    ```Meta``` declares the ```description``` and the JSON-schema ```parameters```
    sent to the model, plus any setting of the tool's own (overridden per
    item by its ```options```); a subclass overrides those keys and ```exec```
    does the work. The handler reads them from ```_meta```.
