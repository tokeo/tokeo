class TokeoAiSandbox(MetaMixin):
    """
    Base class for sandboxes that contain a tool's execution.

    A guard decides whether a call may run; a sandbox is the dumb wall that
    contains the run. The handler loop calls ```sandbox.exec(tool, arguments)```
    in place of a bare ```tool.exec```; before/after guards stay around that
    seam. The sandbox is chosen per agent: a tool runs in the first sandbox of
    the agent's chain whose tools contain it (the ```ai.sandboxes```
    selection), so the same tool can run in process, in a subprocess, or
    in a container without knowing where. Both layers use the verb
    ```exec``` (never ```run```).

    Its class is resolved from the ```ai.sandboxes``` item ```type``` (a built-in
    short name or a dotted path) and instantiated with the application and the
    item's ```options``` as Meta overrides by the ```app.ai``` handler. Like a
    provider, it holds no mutable per-call state.

    ### Notes

    : Honesty over promises. A sandbox only enforces what its mechanism truly
        can: ```in_process``` isolates nothing, ```subprocess``` is fault/resource
        isolation (a memory cap and a wall-clock timeout), not a jail. Real
        path or network isolation needs a container/VM/WASM backend the user
        supplies.

        ```validate_options```. ```in_process``` has no options at all.

        ```ToolResult``` out. Across a process boundary only the JSON-able
        arguments and the ```ToolResult``` text/data cross; in process any
