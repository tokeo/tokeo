Classes
-------
App
    A proxy class that provides access to the attributes and methods of the shared app object.

Functions
---------
load(app_to_share)
    Sets the Cement app object to be shared globally.

class App:
    """
    A proxy class to access the shared app object.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _app : object
        The actual Cement app object.

    Methods
    -------
    __getattr__(key)
        Returns the attribute of the app object corresponding to the key.

        """
        Initializes the App class with a None value for the _app attribute.

        Returns
        -------
        The attribute of the app object if it exists.

        Raises
